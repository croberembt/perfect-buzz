This is a personal project creating an online BAC (blood alcohol content) calculator that will eventually allow users to create an account, track their drinking history, and manage moderate and responsible drinking. It is partially intended to fill the gap for iPhone users because Apple does not allow for comprehensive BAC calculators without purchasing a breathalyzer. This also does not necessarily account for BAC over time, an integral part of BAC tracking. It was inspired by my own use of these resources before Apple changed its policy. My goal is to create the most comprehensive mobile website on the market.
